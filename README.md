OBS Recording Status - Home Assistant Custom Component
This custom integration for Home Assistant allows you to monitor the recording status of OBS Studio (Open Broadcaster Software) using its WebSocket API. It provides a binary sensor that updates in real-time when OBS starts or stops recording.

Features
Real-Time Monitoring: Tracks the recording status of OBS Studio.

Easy Setup: Configure via the Home Assistant UI.

Lightweight: Uses the obsws-python library for efficient communication.

Customizable: Adjust the polling interval to suit your needs.

Prerequisites
OBS Studio installed and running.

OBS WebSocket Server enabled:

Open OBS ‚Üí Tools ‚Üí WebSocket Server Settings.

Enable "Enable WebSocket server".

Set a port (default: 4455) and password.

Click "Apply".

Home Assistant installed and running.

HACS (Home Assistant Community Store) installed. Install HACS.

Installation
Method 1: Install via HACS (Recommended)
Click the button below to automatically add this repository to HACS:

Open your Home Assistant instance and open the repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.

In HACS, go to Integrations and search for "OBS Recording Status".

Click Install.

Restart Home Assistant.

Method 2: Manual Installation
Download this repository.

Copy the obs_recording folder to your Home Assistant custom_components directory:

Copy
config/custom_components/obs_recording/
Restart Home Assistant.

Configuration
Go to Settings > Devices & Services > Integrations.

Click Add Integration and search for "OBS Recording Status".

Enter the following details:

Host: IP address of the machine running OBS (e.g., 192.168.1.100).

Port: WebSocket server port (default: 4455).

Password: WebSocket server password.

Click Submit.

Usage
Once configured, a new binary sensor will be created:

Entity ID: binary_sensor.obs_recording_status

State:

on: OBS is recording.

off: OBS is not recording.

You can use this sensor in automations, scripts, or dashboards. For example:

yaml
Copy
automation:
  - alias: Notify when OBS starts recording
    trigger:
      platform: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.obs_recording_status
      to: "on"
    action:
      service: notify.notify
      data:
        message: "OBS has started recording!"
Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Sensor shows as unavailable:

Ensure OBS is running and the WebSocket server is enabled.

Verify the host, port, and password are correct.

Check your firewall settings to allow communication between Home Assistant and OBS.

Errors in the logs:

Enable debug logging by adding the following to your configuration.yaml:

yaml
Copy
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.obs_recording: debug
    obsws_python: debug
Restart Home Assistant and check the logs for detailed error messages.

Connection issues:

Ensure the OBS WebSocket server is accessible from the Home Assistant machine.

Test connectivity using a tool like telnet or curl.
